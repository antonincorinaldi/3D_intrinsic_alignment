# 3D intrinsic alignment

The intrinsic alignment of the galaxies corresponds to the **alignment** of the galaxies at very large scales along the filaments of the **cosmic web**, due to their interaction with the underlying **tidal field of dark matter**. It induces correlations between the **shapes** and the **orientations** of the galaxies accross the sky. It is a fundamental effect to probe the **3D properties** of the **large-scale structures** of the Universe. 

In the litterature, the intrinsic alignment of galaxies have already been measured by analyzing correlations between their **2D shapes** that one can direclty measure with their observed projected images. The limitation of this is that there is an information about the intrinsic alignment signal that is lost due to the projection in 2D. The aim of this project is to regain this information by analyzing correlations between the **3D shapes** of the galaxies, measured from their projected images. 

The scientific purpose is to have a better understanding of the full 3D interaction between the galaxies and the underlying **environment of dark matter** in which they were formed and evolve.
